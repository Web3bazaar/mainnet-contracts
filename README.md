## üìù About the Bazaar

The Web3 Bazaar is a dApp supported by non-custodial escrow contracts that enable peer-to-peer swaps of ERC-20, ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens. The contracts' only purpose is to swap asset ownership from one wallet address to another under according to the terms pre-established by both parties.

### Bazaar contracts are:

- <b>fully permisionless</b>: every token from a supported standard can be traded by every wallet withouth censorship.
- <b>non-custodial</b>: Your assets never leave your wallet until the trade is complete.
- <b>free to use</b>: no fees are charged to access or swap assets within the Bazaar (apart from gas fees)
- <b>bundle transaction enabled</b>: asset owners can do 1:1 trades or mix assets in a bundle to trade for another set of assets owned by the counter-party.

### Networks available

## üßû smart contract features:

- Establishing trade terms between two different wallet addresses (a creator wallet and an executor wallet)
- trade terms can involve single or bundles of ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens from the networks it is hosted in.
- there's a limit of 1,000 assets allowed per party per trade
- the contract never stores or recieves assets in order to execute a trade
- the contract only stores the data about trade terms in it
- The smart contract verifies the ownership of assets from both parties before executing a swap
- a swap is executed only after both parties confirm the trade and the verification is succesfull
- a swap occurs with assets moving from one wallet to another in the same transaction
- a trade can be cancelled both by the creator and executor, making it unexecutable by anyone
- only wallet addresses provided in trade terms can execute a trade

## üîÑ Contract state machine:

The contract handles a state machine within in order to determine and limit the methods that are interactable according to the actions already performed by the parties.

| State     | Description                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Created   | Terms are established in the contract and counter-party can now execute the trade. Both parties can change the state to "Cancelled" |
| Completed | Counter-party executed the trade and assets swapped wallets. The trade can't be executed anymore                                    |
| Cancelled | One of the parties cancelled the trade and it can't be executed anymore                                                             |

## ‚ú® Contract Methods

### 1.startTrade

A trade is started by the Creator who provides the terms (assets' smart contract addresses and counter-party wallet address).
The smart contract procceeds with its validation an checks if all the assets belong to the wallet addresses provided and if the creator gave the necessary permissions for the smart contract to perform the swap. if an issue is detected the, the trade isn't submitted and the code returns an error as describbed in the ERROR LIST at the end of this Readme.

#### Method Description

| Parameter              | Input                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| creatorTokenAddress[]  | smart contract address of the asset you're going to deposit                                                   |
| creatorTokenId[]       | for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 assets only. Input the specific ID of the NFT you're depositing                      |
| creatorAmount[]        | amount of assets to deposit. Non-applicable to ERC-721 assets                                                 |
| creatorTokenType[]     | "1" for native token, "2" for ERC-20, "3" for ERC-721 or "4" for ERC-1155                                     |
| executerAddress        | wallet address of the trade counterparty                                                                      |
| executorAssetContract  | smart contract address of the asset expected form counterparty                                                |
| executorTokenAddress[] | "1" for native token, "2" for ERC-20, "3" for ERC-721 or "4" for ERC-1155                                     |
| executorTokenId[]      | for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 assets only. nNput the specific ID of the NFT you're expecting from the counterparty |
| executorAmount[]       | amount of assets to deposit. Non-applicable to ERC-721 assets                                                 |
| executorTokenType[]    | "1" for native token, "2" for ERC-20, "3" for ERC-721 or "4" for ERC-1155                                     |

> Note: Once this method is called, the smart contract will return a unique `tradeId` value that will be used by the methods below in order to limit the operations to the designtaed parties and assets.

The contract then internally stores all the trade terms and assets' data depicted below:
![Fig.1](/assets/trades-image.png)

### 2.executeTrade

When a trade is submitted and enters `created` status and the counter-party becomes able to execute it. to do so, counter-party must first approve the contract methods to move its assets.
A verification of the ownership of the assets provided in the trade terms is performed again before executing it.
Upon succesful verification the contract executes the swap and changes the status of the trade to `Completed`

#### Method Description

| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| tradeId   | Input value returned by `startTrade` method |

### 3.getTrade

Get Trade methods gives information about the trade based on the `tradeId and user wallet. It returns asset's swapped in that trade.

| -------------- | ------------ |
| tradeId        | tradeId      |
| userWallet     | user address |
